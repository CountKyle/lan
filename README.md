# LAN Party
## 2021 Edition

That's right boys and girls, we're going tape Alex to the ceiling and (lan) party like it's 1999. 

Games list:

- Payday 2
- Rainbow 6 Seige
- Call of Duty Black Ops w/ Bots
- Call of Duty World at War
- Ashes of a Singularity

Optional Extras:

- CS:GO (Think this is free to play or we all have it)
- ARMA 3 (Good for a muck about, think we all have it)
- Killing Floor 2 (Pretty sure we shot a bunch of monsters last time round)
- Sea of Thieves (A sloop and a brigantine could be fun if we can get on to the same server)
